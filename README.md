Intelligent Agent for Breast Cancer Prediction

Project Description:
The goal of this project is to develop an application that uses a predictive machine learning model for classifying medical data into two categories: malignant and benign tumors. The model will be developed based on a dataset that includes various tumor characteristics, such as size, shape, texture, and other parameters.

The application will allow users (medical professionals or researchers) to enter tumor characteristics (such as radius, texture, perimeter, etc.) into a simple form. The application will then use a pre-trained model to predict and classify the entered data into one of two categories: Malignant (M) or Benign (B).

The project includes:
1. Data Collection: Using a publicly available dataset, such as the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin" dataset, to allow the model to learn about tumor characteristics.
2. **Machine Learning Model Development:** Developing and training the model using the logistic regression algorithm.
3. Web Application: Developing a simple web application that enables users to input parameters and view the prediction results in real-time.
4. Use of Flask: Flask will be used to build the backend server that handles requests and predictions.
5. User Interface: Creating a simple frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for data input and displaying prediction results.

Technologies Used: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JS.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates how advanced technologies such as machine learning and web applications can be beneficial in the healthcare sector, enabling faster and more accurate diagnoses, which can significantly impact the quality and speed of medical care.
